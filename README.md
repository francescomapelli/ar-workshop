# Welcome!

Before we get started, take a few minutes to:

- Clone this project.
- Check that Android Studio is updated to 3.1 or later.
- Set up an [ARCore supported device](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) or configure your [emulator](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/emulator).

A link to the presentation slides can be found [here](slides.pdf).

This sample project and slides are in Kotlin. If you'd prefer to follow along using Java, you can find completed Java versions of the snippets we're adding in this project [here](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/hellosceneform) and [here](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/augmentedfaces).

This workshop is based on Google's [Sceneform codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/sceneform-intro/) and [Augmented Faces sample app](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk/tree/master/samples/augmentedfaces). Check out their [sample apps](https://github.com/google-ar/sceneform-android-sdk) for more ideas on what you can do with ARCore + Sceneform.

## Emulator troubleshooting

- Check that your Android Emulator is updated to 27.2.9 or later.
- Follow Google's [instructions to update ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/emulator) on your emulator.
